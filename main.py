#now that the website is built and running the user can see the results 
#within flask a button needs to be made so it can be converted and downloaded as a pdf
#Another button at the bottom needs to be made to run again so that the user can change the files and run again 
#Lastly is the user is done with the program need to decide how to end and kill the proccesses 
#most likely going to need to do a grep| kill -9 so that it both cant be overwritten and that children process are ended aswell



###notes on futher implimentations that may be needed
#when the user reruns the program there could be a chache overload issue meaning the old program needs to be killed first 
#the manipulation of the arrays needs to be done so purposfully so that multiple grp files are paid attention to 
#may need to label onthe user front end first so that data has context as it loads in
